# Independent coder & video production specialist
- 👋 Hi, I’m Scott (@vi-vi-io). 
- 👀 I’m interested in browser based interactive video -- web app video integration with JS libs / APIs from streaming providers (Youtube, Vimeo, Kaltura, etc...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Static site generators (jekyll, gatsby); Continuous deployment w/ Netlify; ES6;
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video-centric projects, by either bringing my fresh ideas and demonstrated coding skills to your project, or by soliciting your skills and ideas to further my own ventures.
